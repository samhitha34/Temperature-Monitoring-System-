# Temperature Sensor with Arduino and NTC 10k Sensor

## Description

The temperature sensor is built using an NTC 10k thermistor, which changes its resistance in response to changes in temperature.
The resistance of the thermistor is measured using the Arduino's analog input, and the temperature is calculated using 
the Steinhart-Hart equation.

## Materials

* Arduino board
* NTC 10k thermistor
* 10kÎ© resistor

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/devpedrofurquim/Temperature-Sensor-With-Arduino`
2. Upload the code to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.
3. Connect the NTC 10k sensor and the other components as shown in the circuit diagram.
4. Power on the Arduino board and the circuit.

## Usage

To use the temperature sensor, connect the NTC 10k thermistor to the Arduino according to the circuit diagram, 
and upload the code to the Arduino board. Open the serial monitor in the Arduino IDE to view the temperature readings.
